# The F1TENTH Gym environment with Google Colab

This is the repository of the [F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.org/) Gym environment with [Google Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) integration.

#### F1TENTH Gym with Reinforcement Learning implementation:

This project is still under heavy developement.

You can find the [documentation](https://f1tenth-gym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of the environment here.

## Quickstart
We recommend installing the simulation inside a virtualenv. You can install the environment by running:

### Google Colab:

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/avantgarda/f1tenth_gym.git # cloning from avantgarda fork of the F1Tenth repo
%cd /content/f1tenth_gym
!git checkout colab # colab-compatible branch
%cd /content/f1tenth_gym/gym
!python setup.py install
```

### Local machine:

```bash
virtualenv gym_env
source gym_env/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym.git
cd f1tenth_gym
pip install -e .
```

Then you can run a quick waypoint follow example by:
```bash
cd examples
python3 waypoint_follow.py
```

A Dockerfile is also provided with support for the GUI with nvidia-docker (nvidia GPU required):
```bash
docker build -t f1tenth_gym_container -f Dockerfile .
docker run --gpus all -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix f1tenth_gym_container
````
Then the same example can be ran.

## Known issues
- Library support issues on Windows. You must use Python 3.8 as of 10-2021
- On MacOS Big Sur and above, when rendering is turned on, you might encounter the error:
```
ImportError: Can't find framework /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework.
```
You can fix the error by installing a newer version of pyglet:
```bash
$ pip3 install pyglet==1.5.11
```
And you might see an error similar to
```
gym 0.17.3 requires pyglet<=1.5.0,>=1.4.0, but you'll have pyglet 1.5.11 which is incompatible.
```
which could be ignored. The environment should still work without error.
